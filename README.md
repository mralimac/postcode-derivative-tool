# Postcode Derivativing Tool

This tool can used in an excel spreadsheet that contains addresses but no postcodes. It will rapidly cycle through each row in a column and attempt to retrieve the postcode for each one

A limit of 2000 requests per 24 hours is imposed by Google. But this can be increased to 10000 if an API key is purchased ($0.5/1000 requests)
